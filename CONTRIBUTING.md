# Contributing to Awesome MCP Servers for DevOps

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This list aims to be the most comprehensive resource for DevOps-focused MCP servers.

## How to Contribute

### Adding a New MCP Server

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Add your entry** to the appropriate category in `README.md`
3. **Submit a Pull Request** with a clear description

### Entry Format

Use this table format:

```markdown
| :icon: **Server Name** | Brief description of what it does. | [Link Text](https://url) |
```

**Icons (pick one):**
- `:medal_military:` — Official implementation (by the tool's creators)
- `:snake:` — Python
- `:card_index:` — TypeScript/JavaScript
- `:racing_car:` — Go
- `:crab:` — Rust
- `:hash:` — C#
- `:coffee:` — Java

### Requirements for New Entries

Your MCP server submission should:

- [ ] Be relevant to DevOps workflows (infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring, security, etc.)
- [ ] Have a working implementation (not just a concept)
- [ ] Include a public repository or documentation link
- [ ] Have a clear description (1-2 sentences)
- [ ] Be placed in the correct category

### Quality Guidelines

**Do include:**
- Actively maintained projects
- Servers with clear documentation
- Tools that solve real DevOps problems

**Avoid:**
- Abandoned projects (no commits in 12+ months without explanation)
- Duplicate functionality without clear differentiation
- Servers that require paid access with no free tier (unless official)
