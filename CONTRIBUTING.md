# Contributing

Want to add an MCP server to this list? Here's how.

## Requirements

Every submission must have:

1. **A working public link** — GitHub repo, official docs, or both
2. **DevOps relevance** — Infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring, security, cloud, or containers
3. **Active maintenance** — Recent commits or clear maintenance status

No placeholder links. No "coming soon" projects.

## How to Submit

### Option 1: Pull Request

1. Fork the repo
2. Add your entry to the appropriate section in `README.md`
3. Follow the existing format (see below)
4. Submit a PR with a one-line description

### Option 2: Issue

Open an issue with:
- Server name
- Link to repo/docs
- What it does (one sentence)
- Why it's useful for DevOps

## Entry Format

Use this structure:

```markdown
### Server Name

Brief description of what makes this useful.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Repo** | [org/repo-name](https://github.com/org/repo-name) |
| **Maintainer** | Organization (Official) or Community |
| **What it does** | Core functionality |
```

Add relevant fields like `**Docs**`, `**Status**`, `**Note**`, or `**Requires**` as needed.

## What We Look For

**Good additions:**
- Official implementations from tool creators
- Well-documented community projects with real usage
- Servers that solve actual DevOps problems

**We'll reject:**
- Experiments with no documentation
- Abandoned projects (no activity in 12+ months)
- Duplicate functionality without differentiation
- Missing or broken links

## New Categories

Want to propose a new category? Open an issue with:
- Category name
- At least 3 servers that would fit
- Why existing categories don't work
