# 🤝 Contributing

Want to add an MCP server to this list? Here's how.

## ✅ Requirements

Every submission must have:

1. 🔗 **A working public link** — GitHub repo, official docs, or both
2. 🔧 **DevOps relevance** — Infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring, security, cloud, or containers
3. 🔄 **Active maintenance** — Recent commits or clear maintenance status

❌ No placeholder links. No "coming soon" projects.

## 📬 How to Submit

### Option 1: Pull Request

1. 🍴 Fork the repo
2. ✏️ Add your entry to the appropriate section in `README.md`
3. 📝 Follow the existing format (see below)
4. 🚀 Submit a PR with a one-line description

### Option 2: Issue

Open an issue with:
- 📛 Server name
- 🔗 Link to repo/docs
- 💬 What it does (one sentence)
- 🎯 Why it's useful for DevOps

## 📋 Entry Format

Use this structure:

```markdown
### Server Name

Brief description of what makes this useful.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Repo** | [org/repo-name](https://github.com/org/repo-name) |
| **Maintainer** | 🏷️ Organization (Official) or 👥 Community |
| **What it does** | Core functionality |
```

Add relevant fields like `**Docs**`, `**Status**`, `**Note**`, or `**Requires**` as needed.

## 🔍 What We Look For

**✅ Good additions:**
- 🏷️ Official implementations from tool creators
- 📚 Well-documented community projects with real usage
- 🎯 Servers that solve actual DevOps problems

**❌ We'll reject:**
- 🧪 Experiments with no documentation
- 💀 Abandoned projects (no activity in 12+ months)
- 🔄 Duplicate functionality without differentiation
- 🔗 Missing or broken links

## 📁 New Categories

Want to propose a new category? Open an issue with:
- 📛 Category name
- 📦 At least 3 servers that would fit
- 💡 Why existing categories don't work
